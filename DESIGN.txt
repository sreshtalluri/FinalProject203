Most of the functions that we went over in class, I put them where we stated.

The reasoning for my placements were which data was being used the most and for the functions
with an Entity in its name, it was usually the Entity class. The other reason was where it would logically go.
For example, it makes sense for addEntity to go in WorldModel rather than the Entity class. Overall,
most of them went to the Entity class or the WorldModel class (makes sense).

I left a good amount of Methods in the Function class due to the fact that they were math related, created
objects, parsing, and processing information. Things that aren't specific to one class.
